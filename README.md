# Hey, I'm Ollie ðŸ‘‹
I'm a .NET programmer. I've been working with C# full-time since January of 2021.

I've also worked with C++, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and OpenGL.

I love working with graphics, making weird and stupid games.

Looking for some work, if you like what I do, feel free to send an email!
