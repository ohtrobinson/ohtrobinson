# How to find your Steam ID
Finding your Steam ID is easy, however not always intuitive at first glance. This guide will show you how to find your Steam ID in 7 easy steps.

### What do we use your Steam ID for?
The main purpose of your Steam ID is to add you to the server whitelist. If you don't provide a valid Steam ID, we can't whitelist you!

The bot also stores your Steam ID. This is so, if need be, we can change things about you in-game, for example, changing your rank. And if worst comes to worst, we also store your Steam ID just in case we need to revoke your verification for whatever reason.

### Guide

First, you'll want to head to [steamid.io](https://steamid.io).

![SteamID.io](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52220544/120888363-d9fca180-c5ef-11eb-9abb-f557c7e3e7d9.png)

You should see a page like this.

Next, you'll want to find the button you see in the image below (highlighted in an r/uselessredcircle)

You should be prompted to sign in.

Don't worry, steamid.io is a trusted site, all personal details are handled via steam itself, steamid.io does not keep any of your personal details on file.

The log in button should have now changed to your steam profile picture.

Click on it, and click the "profile" button.

You should see this page.

You can use any of the following IDs.

**Make sure you copy the whole ID, not just the numbers!!!** You can use the little page symbol at the right to automatically copy the whole ID if you are unsure.

While Space Engineers itself uses Steam64 IDs, the bot will automatically convert Steam2 and Steam3 IDs to the correct format.

And that's it!
